                Welcome to my personal website! I'm excited to share some information about myself here.<br><br>
                My name is Qikang Zhang, and I am currently a Student. I major in Artificial Intelligence and I am passionate about this field.<br><br>
                I am studying at South China Normal University pursuing a Bachelor. Here, I have taken many courses related to AI, such as Calculus, Linear Algebra.<br><br>
                My career goal is to become a engineer. I hope to achieve significant accomplishments in Embodied AI and use my knowledge to contribute to society.<br><br>
                In addition to my work and studies, I enjoy travelling. I have been to England and Japan. And this summer vacation I plan to visit NTU in Singapore. Travelling not only help me relax but also allow me to continually learn and grow.
